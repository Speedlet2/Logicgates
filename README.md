# Logicgates
Hi! This is a small PCB I created for Hack club solder, with the idea of being able to show the most basic logic gates: NOT; AND and OR. It has two input buttons, is powered by a single CR2032 cell and has four output LEDs.

BoM
This project uses: 2 6mm switches; 4 LEDs (3mm used on the schematic, can easily use 5mm); 6 NPN transistors (2N3904); 2 220Î© resistors and a single CR2032 cell holder! The idea with this project is that it simply demonstates the combination of transistors that can be used to form logic gates, and the single PCB design is meant to be followed for beginners to understand the connections!

Whilst this isnt my first project in KiCAD, it is designed to be my most guarenteed to work as my previous attempts have born very little fruit (I sometimes struggle with attempting too complex problems for my skill level and then not having tghe ability to attempt a V2 ðŸ˜†)
